# kUnban

Simple kanban app based on solid-start. It's highly experimental

## Stuffs:
- solid-start - heart of app. Rendering, ssr, routing, server ect.
- prisma - orm for database
- tailwind powered by unocss - styling
- unocss:presetIcons - use all incons inside css
- typescript - types
- unplugin-auto-import - you don't need to import most used stuff
- eslint - lint you code
- pnpm - main package manager

## Helpers (small but useful)
- clsx - join tailwind classes
